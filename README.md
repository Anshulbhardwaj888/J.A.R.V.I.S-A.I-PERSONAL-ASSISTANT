## Is it an A.I.?

Many people will argue that the virtual assistant that we have created is not an A.I, but it is the output of a bunch of the statement. But, if we look at the fundamental level, the sole purpose of A.I develop machines that can perform human tasks with the same effectiveness or even more effectively than humans.

It is a fact that our virtual assistant is not a very good example of A.I., but it is an A.I.!
